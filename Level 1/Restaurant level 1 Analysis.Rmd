DATA EXPLORATION importing dataset and viewing the dataset

```{r}
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
Dataset_bA <- read.csv("C:/Users/Mideh/Downloads/Dataset_bA.csv")

```

```{r}
# checking the structure and the first 7 rows of the dataset and renaming the dataset
head(Dataset_bA,7)
structure(Dataset_bA)
D_A <- Dataset_bA
```

```{r}
# checking to see for blanks in the entire dataset and in the Cuisines column
sum(D_A == "", na.rm = TRUE)  
sum(D_A$Cuisines == "")  

```

There were 9 blanks in the dataset which were found in the Cuisines column

```{r}
#cleaning the dataset by removing the NA
D_A[D_A == ""] <- NA               
D_A_clean <- na.omit(D_A)
```

```{r}
loading necesaary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

```

Task 1: TOP CUISINES AND THEIR PERCENTAGES

```{r}
#Split the 'Cuisines' column to handle multiple cuisines per restaurant
D_A_cuisines <- D_A_clean %>%
  separate_rows(Cuisines, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(Cuisines = trimws(Cuisines))  # Remove extra spaces
print(D_A_cuisines)

```

```{r}
# Count occurrences of each cuisine
top_cuisines <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Cuisines) %>% 
  summarise(restaurant_count = n_distinct(Restaurant.ID)) %>%  # Count distinct Restaurant_ID
  arrange(desc(restaurant_count)) %>%
  top_n(3, restaurant_count)

# Calculate percentage of restaurants serving each top cuisine
total_restaurants <- nrow(D_A_clean)
top_cuisines <- top_cuisines %>%
  mutate(percentage = (restaurant_count / total_restaurants) * 100)

# View results
print(top_cuisines)
```

Task 2: CITY ANALYSIS

```{r}
# Step 1: Identify the City with the Highest Number of Restaurants

city_restaurant_count <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarise(restaurant_count = n_distinct(Restaurant.ID)) %>%  # Count distinct Restaurant_ID
  arrange(desc(restaurant_count))

# Display the city with the highest number of restaurants
city_with_most_restaurants <- city_restaurant_count[1, ]
print(city_with_most_restaurants)


```

```{r}
# Step 2: Calculate the Average Rating for Restaurants in Each City

city_avg_rating <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarise(average_rating = mean(Aggregate.rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_rating))

# Display the average rating for each city
print(city_avg_rating)
```

```{r}
# Step 3: Determine the City with the Highest Average Rating

city_with_highest_avg_rating <- city_avg_rating[1, ]
print(city_with_highest_avg_rating)

```

Task 3: RANGE DISTRIBUTION

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Step 1: Create a Bar Chart of Price Range Distribution
# Assuming the 'Price range' column is already present in your dataset

ggplot(D_A_cuisines, aes(x = Price.range)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "yellow") +
  labs(title = "Price Range Distribution", x = "Price Range", y = "Number of Restaurants") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Step 2: Calculate the Percentage of Restaurants in Each Price Range Category
price_range_distribution <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Price.range) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = (count / sum(count)) * 100)

# Print the price range distribution with percentages
print(price_range_distribution)
```

Task 4: ONLINE DELIVERY

```{r}
# Step 1: Determine the Percentage of Restaurants that Offer Online Delivery

# Calculate the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery
online_delivery_percentage <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Has.Online.delivery) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = (count / sum(count)) * 100)

# Print the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery
print(online_delivery_percentage)
```

```{r}
# Step 2: Compare the Average Ratings of Restaurants With and Without Online Delivery

# Calculate the average rating for restaurants with and without online delivery
avg_ratings_online_delivery <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Has.Online.delivery) %>%
  summarise(average_rating = mean(Aggregate.rating, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print the comparison of average ratings
print(avg_ratings_online_delivery)
```

```{r}
# Step 1 Analyze the Distribution of Aggregate Ratings

# Create a histogram of the aggregate ratings
ggplot(D_A_cuisines, aes(x = Aggregate.rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Aggregate Ratings", x = "Aggregate Rating", y = "Count of Restaurants") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Step 1.2: Identify the most common rating range
rating_range <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Aggregate.rating)%>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) 
most_common_rating_range <- rating_range[1,]
print(most_common_rating_range)
```

```{r}
# Step 2: Calculate the Average Number of Votes Received by Restaurants

# Calculate the average number of votes
Average_votes <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  summarise(average_votes = mean(Votes, na.rm = TRUE))


# Step 1: Identify the Most Common Combinations of Cuisines
# Count how many times each cuisine combination appears
Common_cuisines_combination <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Cuisines)%>%
  summarise(count = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count)) 
print(Common_cuisines_combination)
```

```{r}
library(sf)
# Step 2: Determine if Certain Cuisine Combinations Tend to Have Higher Ratings
# Calculate the average aggregate rating for each cuisine combination
cuisines_combinations_ratings <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Cuisines)%>%
  summarise(Avg_rating = mean(Aggregate.rating, count = n()))%>%
  arrange(desc(Avg_rating))

# location of restaurants on a map
# Convert to sf object using longitude and latitude
restaurants_sf <- st_as_sf(D_A_cuisines, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Create the plot
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = restaurants_sf) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Restaurant Locations", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")

```

```{r}
# Step 1: Identify restaurant chains (restaurants with multiple locations)
restaurant_chains <- D_A_cuisines %>%
  group_by(Restaurant.Name) %>%
  summarise(
    location_count = n_distinct(Restaurant.ID),  # Count distinct Restaurant IDs
    avg_rating = mean(Aggregate.rating),  # Calculate average rating
    total_votes = sum(Votes)  # Sum of votes (popularity)
  ) %>%
  filter(location_count > 1)  # Keep only restaurant chains (more than 1 location)


# Step 2: View the result
print(restaurant_chains)
```

```{r}
# You can sort by average rating or total votes to find the most popular chains
top_rated_chains <- restaurant_chains %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))  # Sort by average rating

print(top_rated_chains)

most_popular_chains <- restaurant_chains %>%
  arrange(desc(total_votes))  # Sort by total votes

print(most_popular_chains)
```
