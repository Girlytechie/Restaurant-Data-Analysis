## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset of restaurants to derive valuable insights into various aspects, including cuisine preferences, geographic distribution, pricing strategies, delivery options, and customer feedback. The analysis is structured into three levels of tasks, each focusing on different analytical angles




## Task Levels And Objectives


#### Level 1: Restaurant Market Insights - Foundational Analysis

• Objectives: To analyze restaurant data to uncover patterns in city-based restaurant counts, pricing distribution, and online delivery services. This analysis aims to inform strategic decisions in restaurant management and marketing by revealing trends in customer preferences and service offerings.

• Significance: This analysis provides insights into market dynamics across cities, helps identify pricing strategies, and assesses the impact of online delivery on customer satisfaction. These findings are valuable for restaurant owners and industry stakeholders seeking to optimize operations, enhance customer experience, and improve competitive positioning

• Task: Conduct an analysis of restaurant data to examine city-based restaurant distributions, price range categorizations, and the impact of online delivery services on customer ratings. This task involves identifying key metrics and visualizations that reveal patterns in city popularity, pricing preferences, and service quality perceptions among restaurants with and without online delivery options.




#### Level 2: Advanced Restaurants Insights and Location Analysis

• Objectives: To explore cuisine combinations, geographic distribution, and the presence of restaurant chains to uncover patterns in customer preferences and restaurant success factors. This analysis provides insights that can help optimize menu offerings, location strategy, and brand performance for restaurants.

• Significance: This analysis is significant for understanding how cuisine pairings, geographic patterns, and chain presence impact restaurant ratings and popularity. The insights gained will support data-driven decisions in menu planning, site selection, and brand expansion, enhancing overall competitiveness

• Task: Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns in cuisine combinations, geographic clustering, and restaurant chain presence. This task includes identifying the most popular cuisine pairings and their relationship to ratings, mapping restaurant locations to find area-based clusters, and assessing the ratings and popularity of restaurant chains versus independent establishments.




#### Level 3: Comprehensive Restaurants Performance Analysis
• Objectives: To investigate customer engagement and service offerings in relation to restaurant pricing and rating. This analysis will assess the influence of customer votes on ratings and determine if premium restaurants are more likely to provide online delivery and table booking options.

• Significance: This analysis is essential for understanding customer voting behavior and the relationship between service offerings and restaurant price range. Insights will guide restaurant managers and marketers in tailoring service options to align with customer expectations and price positioning

• Task: Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns in cuisine combinations, geographic clustering, and restaurant chain presence. This task includes identifying the most popular cuisine pairings and their relationship to ratings, mapping restaurant locations to find area-based clusters, and assessing the ratings and popularity of restaurant chains versus independent establishments.




## Data Analytical Tools Used
• R: For Data cleaning, transformation and statistical analysis.

• Powerbi: For Data Visualization



## Derived Insights

The dataset consists of 9,551 restaurant records with 21 columns.

A count of 9 null values were detected within the 'Cuisines' column.

No duplicates existed, and data type were accurate, therefore there was no need for a conversion

New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida, Farizabad and Ghaziabad happens to be the top 5 in restaurant counts.

Popular cuisines included North Indian, Chinese and Fast food.

North America and Asia, especially India, were prominent for restaurant presence.

New Delhi is the city with the most restaurants, after than Gurgaon and Noida respectively.

Majority of the restaurants (70.57%) do not offer online delivery services, while only (29.43%) does.

There happens to be no correlation between number of votes and customers ratings

Price range 1 was the most common among restaurants.

Restaurants in price range 4 achieved the highest average rating, followed by price ranges 3, 2, and 1.



## Recommendations


• Expansion of Online Delivery Services: With only 29.43% of restaurants currently offering online delivery, expanding the online delivery service could increase customer reach and competitiveness. Targeting cities with lower delivery options (outside the top cities) might enhance market share in underserved areas.

• High-Quality Service in Premium Segments should be focused on: Given that restaurants in the higher price ranges tend to have higher ratings, new or existing restaurants might consider enhancing their service and menu quality. This could help capture a niche market willing to pay more for an elevated dining experience.

• Emerging Cities should be targeted for Expansion: Since New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida are saturated, restaurant businesses could consider emerging cities or suburban areas with lower restaurant density. This approach may reduce competition and enhance brand loyalty among local customers.

• Pricing Strategy: Restaurants in lower price ranges (1 and 2) might explore value-adding services (such as special meal deals or combo offers) to appeal to budget-conscious customers while improving their rating and customer satisfaction levels.
